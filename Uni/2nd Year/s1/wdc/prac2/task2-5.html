		<h1>This page is all about divs!</h1>
		<p>This page looks much cleaner now that I've put my content in a div with a white background.</p>
		<p>Because this div is special, it has it's own id, "content".<br>This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.</p>
		<hr>
		<p>This is a normal paragraph, except <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span><span class="fancy"> and this span has a font-family of cursive</span>,<br> because they belongs to two classes called "blue" and "fancy" respectively.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy&excl;</span></p>

		<p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
